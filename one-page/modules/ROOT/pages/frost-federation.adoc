= FROST Federation

Radpool depends on a federation of nodes that run the
https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf[FROST threshold signature
protocol] as well as a distributed key generation protocol included in
the same paper (called KeyGen). We have an implementation of a node
for running a syndicate that uses KeyGen protocol to determine a
shared public key. The syndicate then uses the FROST threshold
signature protocol to sign messages that settle futures contracts
paying miners from the liquidity provided by the federation members.

The FROST Federation is a Strong Federation as per the definition
implied in https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05491:[Strong Federations: An
Interoperable Blockchain Solution to Centralized Third-Party Risks]
and used in
https://blockstream.com/assets/downloads/pdf/liquid-whitepaper.pdf:[Liquid:
A Bitcoin Sidechain]. FROST Federation is both publicly verifiable and
and makes progress in the presence of Byzantine failures.

The https://github.com/pool2win/frost-federation:[FROST Federation
implementation] is an independent project as other applications apart
from Radpool can use it for other purposes.

== Membership

The DKG protocol provides a BFT consensus between the parties to agree
on the membership. Every fixed interval all connected nodes can run a
DKG instance to obtain the **syndicate public key**
stem:[S_{pk}]. However, as we will see later, the syndicate signs DLC
contracts that pay miners. This means that we can't simply depend on a
BFT agreement to decide on who gets to sign the DLC contracts.

Recall that all MSP broadcast mining shares mined by their miners. We
depend on this information to support the membership with verifiable
PoW information. We require that the membership of the syndicate is
limited to the MSPs whose miners make the top 60% of hashrate but
including at least 2/3rd of the syndicated network at the same time.

The membership is therefore determined using the following protocol.

.Protocol for Determining Membership
. Consider only the shares submitted to the syndicated network since the last bitcoin block was found by the pool.
. Group all miner shares received from all miners into groups keyed by the MSP that sent the corresponding mining message.
. Compute the total hashrate for each MSP in their group.
. Order the MSPs by their aggregate hashrate - use the MSP lexicographical ordering on the public key to break ties.
. Select the MSPs from the top of the list and add their hashrate. Stop when the total hashrate adds up to 60% of the total syndicated network hashrate.
. If we have reached 60% of the syndicated network hashrate, but haven't included 2/3rds of the MSP, we continue adding MSPs to the list till the required number is reached.

The above protocol uses PoW to prevent sybil attacks on the syndicate
membership. By limiting the hashrate to 60% of the network hashrate we
discourage parties from purposely running low hashrate MSPs to obtain
more shares in the DKG and TSS protocols. At the same time we require
60% of the Radpool hashrate to decide on the payouts. The approach
dis-incentivises MSPs to retain smaller share of the Radpool
hashrate. If their hashrate is small, larger MSPs will add up to the
60% threshold hashrate and the smaller MSPs will have no shares
in TSS.

At the same time, by also requiring that we atleast include 2/3rd of
the network in the syndicate, we avoid the situation where a single
MSP has 60% of the network hashrate and can control the payout
mechanism.


== Syndicate Broadcast Communication

Once the membership is confirmed, the syndicate also provides a
byzantine fault tolerant reliable broadcast within the syndicate. We
later use this broadcast primitive to replicate shares received by a
MSP to all other MSPs. We use the
https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/papers/dds.pdf[Asynchronous
Verifiable Information Dispersal] protocol to provide the BFT reliable
broadcast. The protocol replicates data across point to point nodes
with low communication complexity while tolerating byzantine failures.

== Syndicate Signature in Single Round

The FROST threshold signature requires that all parties broadcast
their share of the threshold signature. The Radpool payout mechanism
requires payouts for all miners to be made at fixed intervals
corresponding to the range of expiry times for DLC contracts. We
discuss the expiry times in the xref:bitcoin-contracts.adoc[Bitcoin
Contracts] page.

Since all parties know when a signature has to be created, say at
every block, they look at their locally available hashrate date and
immediately broadcast their signature share. The broadcast has a
message complexity of stem:[O(n^2)], but all the messages are exchaged
in a single round. If we generate nonces a priori, the threshold
signature can be generated in a single round. We noted this in the
blog post:
https://blog.opdup.com/development-updates/2024/07/09/frost-signing-for-channel-updates.html[FROST
Threshold Signatures for Multiple Channel Updates].

=== Signing Multiple Messages

As we will explain later, in Radpool the syndicate has consistent
local views. With consistent views each syndicate member generates the
same message to sign without the need to run an agreement
protocol. The syndicate needs to sign a message for each of the
miners. We run an optimistic protocol to sign these messages using
FROST threshold signatures. In case of failures, we run the signature
scheme again with the members that failed removed from the signing
party. Such an approach can delay the signing process for payouts to
miners, however the signing is not in a critical path for the pool to
make progress. We explain the details in the
xref:scalability.adoc[Scalability] section.
